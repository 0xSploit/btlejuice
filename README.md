BtleJuice Framework
===================

Introduction
------------

BtleJuice is a complete framework to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks on
Bluetooth Smart devices (also known as Bluetooth Low Energy). It is composed of:

* an interception core
* an interception proxy
* a dedicated web interface
* Python and Node.js bindings

How to install BtleJuice ?
--------------------------

Installing BtleJuice is a child's play. First of all, make sure your system uses
a recent version of *Node.js* (>=4.3.2). Then, make sure to install all the
required dependencies:

### Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian

```
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
```

###Â Fedora / Other-RPM based

```
sudo yum install bluez bluez-libs bluez-libs-devel
```

Last, install BtleJuice using *npm*:

```
sudo npm install -g btlejuice
```

If everything went well, BtleJuice is ready to use !


How to use BtleJuice ?
----------------------

BtleJuice is composed of two main components: an interception proxy and a core.
These two components are required to run on independent machines in order to
operate simultaneously two bluetooth 4.0+ adapters.

The use of a virtual machine may help to make this framework work on a single
computer.

From your virtual machine, install *btlejuice* and make sure your USB BT4 adapter is available from the virtual machine:

```
$ sudo hciconfig
hci0:	Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB
	BD Address: 10:02:B5:18:07:AD  ACL MTU: 1021:5  SCO MTU: 96:6
	DOWN
	RX bytes:1433 acl:0 sco:0 events:171 errors:0
	TX bytes:30206 acl:0 sco:0 commands:170 errors:0
```

Also make sure your virtual machine has an IP address reachable from the host.

Launch the proxy in your virtual machine:

```
btlejuice-proxy
```

And run the following command on your host machine:

```
# btlejuice -u <Proxy IP address> -w
```

The *-w* flag tells BtleJuice to start the web interface while the *-u* option specifies the proxy's IP address.

The Web User Interface is now available at http://localhost:8080. Note the web server port may be changed through command-line.

Installing the bindings
-----------------------

BtleJuice's Node.js bindings may be installed as well through *npm*:

```
$ sudo npm install -g btlejuice-bindings
```

More information about how to use the Node.js bindings in the [package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/btlejuice-bindings).
